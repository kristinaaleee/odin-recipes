    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My all-time favorite cookie recipe! Buttery, nutty, chewy, flavor-packed. The balance of the bitterness from the dark chocolate, the depth from the brown sugar, and the earthiness from the matcha makes for a perfect bite.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>115g unsalted butter (about 1 stick of butter)</li>
        <li>60g caster sugar</li>
        <li>115g brown sugar</li>
        <li>55g egg (about 1 large egg)</li>
        <li>153g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>12g matcha powder</li>
        <li>2g baking soda</li>
        <li>1g salt</li>
        <li>3g vanilla extract</li>
        <li>70g dark chocolate chips (I prefer ghirardelli 60% cacao)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a microwave.</li>
        <li>Add white sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to a medium bowl. Mix with a whisk.</li>
        <li>Add egg and vanilla extract to the same bowl and mix with whisk until well mixed.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, matcha powder, and baking soda into the bowl. Mix with a spatula until there are no dry spots.</li>
        <li>Add dark chocolate chips and mix until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Put bowl in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 1 hour, allowing the dough to harden. The dough can be left overnight covered and baked the day after. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 340°F.</li>
        <li>Shape about 2 tablespoons of the harden cookie dough into balls and place onto a baking sheet. </li>

        <li>Allow cookies to fully cool before eating. Enjoy!</li>
