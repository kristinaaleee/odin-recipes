    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ onion</li>
            <li>10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs (typically 1–2 thighs)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
            <li>3–4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>For broth:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup dashi</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>For topping:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 sprigs mitsuba or scallions</li>
            <li>shichimi togarashi</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make 1½ cups (300 g, 2 rice cooker cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice to yield 4⅓ cups (660 g) of cooked rice, enough for 2 donburi servings</li>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. <strong>Do not make more than two servings in a medium frying pan.</strong></li>
        </ol>
    <h4>To prepare the broth:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ½ cup dashi, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 2 Tbsp mirin, and 2 tsp sugar in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>To prepare the ingredients:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice ½ onion lengthwise, about ¼ inch (6 mm) wide.</li>
            <li>Chop 4 sprigs mitsuba or some green onions ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide.</li>
            <li>Trim the extra bits of fat and connective tissue from 10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs with the knife.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken thigh along the grain into strips ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) wide. Slice the chicken strips against the grain into pieces about ¾–1 inch (2–2.5 cm) square at diagonal.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a bowl or tray and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp sake. Set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Crack 3–4 large eggs into a bowl. Using a pair of chopsticks, lift the egg whites to “cut“ them 5–6 times into a few smaller clumps. Do not blend the egg whites and yolks. </li>

        </ol>
    <h4>To cook the Oyakodon:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>With the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan. Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover the onions.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken on top of the onions.</li>
            <li>Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for <strong>5 minutes</strong> or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium. With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, avoiding the edges of the pan where the eggs can easily overcook. <em>Try to add more <strong>egg whites</strong> at this stage.</em></li>
            <li>When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to the center and around the edges of the pan. <em>Try to distribute more <strong>egg yolks</strong> so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top.</em></li>
            <li>Add the mitsuba (or green onion) on top and cook on medium low until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runny.</li>
            <li>Serve steamed rice in individual serving bowls. Spoon the cooked chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of pan sauce on top.</li>
            <li><em>Optional: </em> Add togarashi and more green onions on top. Enjoy while hot!</li>
        </ol>
